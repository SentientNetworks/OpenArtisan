  ],
  "abstract": "In this work, we carry out a data archaeology to infer books that are known\nto ChatGPT and GPT-4 using a name cloze membership inference query. We find\nthat OpenAI models have memorized a wide collection of copyrighted materials,\nand that the degree of memorization is tied to the frequency with which\npassages of those books appear on the web. The ability of these models to\nmemorize an unknown set of books complicates assessments of measurement\nvalidity for cultural analytics by contaminating test data; we show that models\nperform much better on memorized books than on non-memorized books for\ndownstream tasks. We argue that this supports a case for open models whose\ntraining data is known.",

  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary performance in various\nlanguage tasks, but high computational requirements hinder their widespread\ndeployment. Speculative decoding, which uses amateur models to predict the\ngeneration of expert models, has been proposed as a way to accelerate LLM\ninference. However, speculative decoding focuses on acceleration instead of\nmaking the best use of the token distribution from amateur models. We proposed\nSpeculative Contrastive Decoding (SCD), an accelerated decoding method\nleveraging the natural contrast between expert and amateur models in\nspeculative decoding. Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that\nSCD can achieve similar acceleration factors as speculative decoding while\nfurther improving the generation quality as the contrastive decoding. The\nanalysis of token probabilities further demonstrates the compatibility between\nspeculative and contrastive decoding. Overall, SCD provides an effective\napproach to enhance the decoding quality of LLMs while saving computational\nresources.",
