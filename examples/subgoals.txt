Break the problem of solving the equation x^2 + x + 1 into subgoals. List these subgoals in order.

@Andrew To solve the equation x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1, consider these subgoals:\n1. Identify the equation type (quadratic).\n2. Attempt to factor the equation.\n3. Use the quadratic formula if factoring is not possible.\n4. Evaluate the roots obtained, and interpret in the context needed.

Create separate messages in the style of this message for each subgoal. Make each subgoal the content of each message. For each message change the system block chain to have as the next element of the chain AI followed by the element client. send these messages through to the message server

send each step into the AI and perform it then send the results back to the client
