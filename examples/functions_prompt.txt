create a dictionary with two keys. The first key is called "type" and this has the value "imported". The second key is functions. This has as its value a list of strings. There is only one value in the list called "somefunction". Convert this to JSON and output this without any reference to my name

write a program that receives its input from stdin. This input is a JSON distionary that contains one key called "parameters". The value of parameters is an array of integers. The program parses this dict and extracts the integers. It then adds the integers up and outputs the result on stdout. create this program and then add it to a dictionary with the following structure. There are two keys called "type" and "functions". Give "type" the value "inline". "functions" is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has two keys "name" and "parameters". There is only one dictionary in the functions list. Make the value of the "name" key be "inline" and the parameters key be a list of integers with each integer a separate element in the list. Now make the parameters value be equal to [2, 3, 13, 20]. Product this main JSON dictionary and output only this.
